# BuildQuest
This is a simple text-based Adventure Game where the player collects and manages an inventory of weapons, armor, and potions while surviving battles. The game features a dynamic inventory system that prevents duplicate armor equips, tracks item usage, and allows the player to take damage while managing health, stamina, and armor.
